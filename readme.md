# Snake!

Learns to play Snake using a neural network and genetic algorithm, mainly just to mess about with genetic algorithms, if the goals was just to write a programme that plays snake there are much better ways of doing it.

Uses [jnn neuralnetwork/genetic algorithm library](https://github.com/marcnorth/jnn)
